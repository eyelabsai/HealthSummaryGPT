# 🚀 Implementation Checklist - Phase 2: Event-Driven Architecture

## 📋 Week 1: Foundation Setup (2-3 hours total)

### Day 1: Google Cloud Setup (30 minutes)
- [ ] Enable Google Cloud Pub/Sub API in your project
- [ ] Create topic `health-events` in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Create service account with Pub/Sub permissions
- [ ] Download service account key JSON file
- [ ] Add service account key to Vercel environment variables

### Day 2: Event Bus Library (45 minutes)
- [ ] Install `@google-cloud/pubsub` dependency
- [ ] Create `lib/eventBus.js` with publish/subscribe helpers
- [ ] Test basic event publishing to ensure connectivity
- [ ] Create event schema validation function

### Day 3: First Event Integration (60 minutes)
- [ ] Modify `/api/transcribe` endpoint to publish `TranscriptReady` event
- [ ] Test event publishing after successful transcription
- [ ] Verify events appear in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Add error handling for event publishing failures

### Day 4: First Consumer (45 minutes)
- [ ] Create Cloud Function for `TranscriptReady` consumer
- [ ] Deploy function and test with sample event
- [ ] Verify function processes events correctly
- [ ] Add logging for debugging

## 📋 Week 2: Smart Reactions (3-4 hours total)

### Day 1: Medication Events (60 minutes)
- [ ] Add `MedicationCreated` event to medication creation flow
- [ ] Add `MedicationUpdated` event to medication updates
- [ ] Test medication events are published correctly

### Day 2: Visit Events (45 minutes)
- [ ] Add `VisitSummaryCreated` event after visit summarization
- [ ] Add `HealthAssistantQuery` event for usage tracking
- [ ] Test visit-related events

### Day 3: Notification Foundation (90 minutes)
- [ ] Create basic notification consumer for `MedicationCreated`
- [ ] Implement web push notification setup
- [ ] Test notification delivery to browser

### Day 4: Testing & Monitoring (45 minutes)
- [ ] Set up basic monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Create event flow visualization
- [ ] Test complete event chain from transcription to notification

## 🔧 Quick Commands

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install @google-cloud/pubsub
```

### Create Event Bus Library
```bash
mkdir -p lib
touch lib/eventBus.js
```

### Deploy Cloud Function
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if not already installed
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Initialize Firebase Functions
firebase init functions

# Deploy function
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Test Event Publishing
```bash
# Create test script
touch test-events.js

# Run test
node test-events.js
```

## 📊 Success Criteria

### Week 1 Complete When:
- [ ] Events are successfully published from transcription endpoint
- [ ] First consumer processes events without errors
- [ ] Monitoring shows event flow end-to-end
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Week 2 Complete When:
- [ ] All major user actions publish events
- [ ] At least one smart reaction (notification) works
- [ ] Event processing is reliable and fast
- [ ] Ready to add more complex consumers

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Pub/Sub permissions**: Ensure service account has `pubsub.publisher` role
2. **Event not received**: Check topic name matches exactly
3. **Function not triggering**: Verify Cloud Function trigger configuration
4. **JSON parsing errors**: Validate event schema structure

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check Pub/Sub topics
gcloud pubsub topics list

# Check subscriptions
gcloud pubsub subscriptions list

# View Cloud Function logs
firebase functions:log
```

## 📝 Notes

- Keep existing functionality working during migration
- Test each step thoroughly before moving to next
- Document any deviations from plan
- Celebrate small wins! 🎉
