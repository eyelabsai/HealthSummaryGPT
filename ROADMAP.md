## 🏗️ **PHASE 2: Event-Driven Architecture Foundation** (Next 1-2 weeks)
**Priority: CRITICAL** | **Effort: Medium** | **Impact: Revolutionary**

> **Why This Matters**: Transform from a "request-response" app to a "reactive intelligence" platform. Every action becomes an event that can trigger smart responses, notifications, and insights.

### 🎯 Event Bus Implementation
- [ ] **Setup Google Cloud Pub/Sub** topic `health-events`
- [ ] **Create event library** `/lib/eventBus.js` with publish/subscribe helpers
- [ ] **Define event schema** with standardized envelope (id, type, timestamp, userId, payload, meta)
- [ ] **Implement event publishing** in existing workflows
- [ ] **Create first consumer** Cloud Function for `TranscriptReady` → auto-summarization
- [ ] **Setup monitoring** dashboard for event flow and processing

### 📊 Core Events to Implement
```javascript
// Phase 2A Events (Week 1)
'AudioUploaded'           // → trigger transcription
'TranscriptReady'         // → trigger summarization  
'VisitSummaryCreated'     // → update health graph
'MedicationCreated'       // → schedule reminders
'MedicationUpdated'       // → recalculate schedule

// Phase 2B Events (Week 2)

## 🛠️ **Implementation Guide: Your First Event**

### Week 1: Setup Foundation
```javascript
// 1. Install dependencies
npm install @google-cloud/pubsub

// 2. Create event bus library
// lib/eventBus.js
export async function publishEvent(type, payload, userId) {
  const event = {
    id: crypto.randomUUID(),
    type,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    userId,
    payload,
    meta: { source: 'healthsummarygpt', schemaVersion: 1 }
  };
  
  await pubsub.topic('health-events').publishMessage({ 
    data: Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(event))
  });
}

// 3. Modify transcription endpoint
app.post('/api/transcribe', async (req, res) => {
  // ... existing transcription code ...
  
  // NEW: Publish event after successful transcription
  await publishEvent('TranscriptReady', {
    transcriptId: generateId(),
    transcript: transcription,
    audioLength: req.file.size
  }, userId);
  
  res.json({ success: true, transcript: transcription });
});
```

### Week 2: First Consumer
```javascript
// Cloud Function: functions/handleTranscriptReady.js
export const handleTranscriptReady = pubsubFunction('health-events', {
  filter: 'attributes.type="TranscriptReady"'
}, async (message) => {
  const event = JSON.parse(message.data.toString());
  const { transcript, userId } = event.payload;
  
  // Auto-summarize the transcript
  const summary = await summarizeTranscript(transcript);
  
  // Save to database
  const visitId = await saveVisit(summary, userId);
  
  // Publish next event
  await publishEvent('VisitSummaryCreated', { visitId, summary }, userId);
});
```

## 📋 **Development Workflow**

### Before Starting Any Feature:
1. **Define the events** it will produce and consume
2. **Design event schema** with versioning in mind
3. **Plan for idempotency** and error handling
4. **Consider downstream consumers** that might benefit
5. **Create monitoring** for the new event types

### Event-First Development:
1. **Start with events** - what happened?
2. **Design consumers** - what should happen next?
3. **Build producers** - how do we detect the event?
4. **Test event flow** - end-to-end scenarios
5. **Monitor and optimize** - performance and reliability

## 🔄 **Migration Strategy**

### Phase 2A: Parallel Implementation
- Keep existing synchronous flows working
- Add event publishing alongside existing code
- Create consumers that duplicate existing functionality
- Validate event flow matches existing behavior

### Phase 2B: Gradual Cutover
- Route increasing percentage of traffic through events
- Compare results between old and new systems
- Fix any discrepancies in event-driven flow
- Fully cut over when confidence is high

### Phase 2C: Legacy Cleanup
- Remove old synchronous code paths
- Optimize event-driven flows
- Add advanced features only possible with events
- Celebrate the transformation! 🎉
