  "specialty": "A short phrase indicating the medical specialty (e.g., 'Ophthalmology')",

If the transcript mentions 'today', 'today's visit', 'today's appointment', or similar phrases indicating this is happening today, return 'TODAY'. If a specific date is mentioned (like 'March 15th'), return that date. If no date context is found, return 'Not specified'.",

    {
      "name": "Corrected medication name (fix any transcription spelling errors)",

      "timing": "e.g., morning, evening, with meals, before bed",

      "laterality": "e.g., left eye, right eye, both eyes (if applicable)",
      "duration": "e.g., 7 days, until finished, ongoing",

Examples: 'Hypertension', 'Diabetes', 'Asthma', 'COPD', 'Coronary Artery Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Disease', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypothyroidism', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'Arthritis', 'Cancer', 'Obesity'. Only include conditions that are explicitly mentioned as being diagnosed, confirmed, or discussed as ongoing issues."
  ]
}

For medications, extract ALL available information including:
- Exact dosage and frequency
- Timing (when to take)
- Route of administration
- Eye laterality for eye medications
- Duration of treatment
- Special instructions or warnings
- Combine everything into a clear, patient-friendly fullInstructions field

For chronic conditions:
- Extract any chronic conditions mentioned in the transcript
- Use standard medical terminology (e.g., 'Hypertension' not 'high blood pressure')
- Only include conditions that are explicitly mentioned as diagnosed or ongoing
- Do not include acute conditions or temporary issues
- If no chronic conditions are mentioned, return an empty array

IMPORTANT: Date Extraction
- If the transcript mentions "today", "today's visit", "today's appointment", "during today's visit", etc., return "TODAY" (not the actual date)
- If a specific date is mentioned (like "March 15th", "last week", "yesterday"), convert it to YYYY-MM-DD format
- Look for context clues like "in today's appointment we discussed", "during this visit", "today I'm here for"
- If no date context is found, return "Not specified"

IMPORTANT: Medication Name Correction
- If a medication name appears to be misspelled or phonetically transcribed incorrectly, correct it to the proper spelling
- Common transcription errors include:
  * Phonetic misspellings (e.g., "cosopt" transcribed as "cosoft", "cosopted")
  * Similar-sounding letters (e.g., "b" vs "p", "f" vs "ph", "c" vs "k")
  * Missing or extra syllables
  * Common drug name variations
- Use your medical knowledge to identify and correct medication names to their standard pharmaceutical spelling
- Consider the medical specialty context to help identify the most likely medication
- If you're unsure about a medication name, make your best educated guess based on context and common medications

If no medications are mentioned, return an empty array for the "medications" key.
If no chronic conditions are mentioned, return an empty array for the "chronicConditions" key.
